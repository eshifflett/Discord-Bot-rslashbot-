### Discord bot that returns reddit link when user messages "/r/&lt;NAME>" or "r/&lt;NAME>"

As the description says, when a user messages either "/r/&lt;NAME>" or "r/&lt;NAME>", it will return a reddit link that links to the subreddit that was inputted by the user (i.e. https://www.reddit.com/r/\<NAME>). This bot will NOT work if added to a server, it is not remotely hosted and this was primarily for my own experience.
