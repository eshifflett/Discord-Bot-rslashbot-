# RSlashBot for Discord
### Discord bot that returns reddit link when user messages "/r/test_name" or "r/test_name"

As the description says, when a user messages either "/r/test_name" or "r/test_name", it will return a reddit link that links to the subreddit that was inputted by the user (i.e. https://www.reddit.com/r/test_name) along with a small acknowledgement message. This bot will NOT work if added to a server, it is not remotely hosted and this was primarily for my own experience.
